The Alleluia2or3flats repository contains a scoop of partial scores.

---
The Alleluia2or3flats repository is a read/write area for developers.
The initial developer is Arthur Lenskold (AL).
A goal is to have the Alleluia2or3flats repository with some sub-repositories,
and for the Alleluia2or3flats repository to have one parent repository, Team_d2scor.

The Alleluia2or3flats repository is an unusual niche.
It is a niche because only a prefix of its lyrics are missing from
the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( Bible ) website.
Therefore the English prefix lyrics for this niche must come
from the Gregorian Missal (Solesmes).

The Gregorian Missal melodies often accommodate only a B flat.
This niche is for those Alleluias requiring a chromatic transpose.
( See the Tempo_FunctionalSpecifications file in the Memos repository ).
